# Database Performance Monitoring and Refinement Report

## Objective:
To monitor and refine database performance by analyzing frequently used query execution plans, identifying bottlenecks, and implementing schema adjustments.

---

## 1. **Monitoring Query Performance**

- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE**: Provides execution plans with runtime statistics.
  
  Example:
  ```sql
  EXPLAIN ANALYZE
  SELECT user_id, COUNT(booking_id)
  FROM Booking
  WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
  GROUP BY user_id;


Ongoing monitoring and optimization ensure better query performance. Implementing indexing, partitioning, and schema changes helps maintain fast response times and scalability as data increases
